# Input the value of n
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if n < 1:
    print("Please enter a positive integer.")
else:
    # Use sum() with a list comprehension to calculate the sum of squares
    total = sum([i**i for i in range(1, n + 1)])
    print("The sum of squares from 1^2 to", n, "^2 is:", total)
First line takes the value of n from user. Then the user is told to pick a number greater than 0 because this code does not work for negative numbers. Then i made sum a variable and defined it as i to the power of itself in the range from 1 to n+1. 

n = int(input("Enter number of rows: "))

for i in range(1,n+1):
    for j in range(1, i+1):
        print(j, end="")
    print()
First line asks for the value of n which is our number of rows. Then we establish i as the variable which controls the number of rows. Then we use i to establish j which controls the amount of numbers in each row. Then i used end=”” to make sure all the numbers are in a horizontal pattern and not alone on a row. 

year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

# Check if it's a leap year
if (year % 4 == 0 ):
    print(year, "is a leap year.")
else:
    print(year, "isn't a leap year.")
 In this code first the user has to put the year in. Then i used if/else to complete the rest of the code. If the year is divisible by 4 then it means it has 366 days so it is a leap year. If it isnt then that means it is not a leap year. 

import math  
radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))
area = math.pi * (radius ** 2)
print("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", round(area, 2))

For area of circle i imported math first to have the value of pi. Then the user enters the radius and i used float so they can put a decimal. I create the variable area after which is pi*radius^2. After that the code prints out the radius and the area. 

side = float(input("Enter the length of the cube's side: "))
surface_area = 6 * side**2
print("The surface area of the cube with side", side, "is", surface_area)

First the user enters the sode length. Then surface_area is made a variable and the formula is entered. Then the code prints out the surface area along with the entered side length.

import math  
radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the cylinder: "))
height = float(input("Enter the height of the cylinder: "))
base = 2 * math.pi * radius**2
lateral = 2 * math.pi * radius * height
total = base + lateral
print("The surface area of the cylinder with radius", radius, "and height", height, "is", round(total, 2))

Radius and height is taken from user. Then base and lateral formulas are added. Total equals the lateral plus base and after that the output is printed. 


import math  
radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the sphere: "))
surface_area = 4 * math.pi * radius**2
print("The surface area of the sphere with radius", radius, "is", round(surface_area, 2))

Radius is taken from the user and surface area is entered as a variable. After adding its formula the code prints out the radius and the corresponding surface area.
